Hi, I'm Derg. I'm a third year CompSci student at university, always looking to expand my skillset and apply my knowledge to different things.
I've got experience in the following programming languages...
- C / C++ / C#
- Python
- Visual Basic
- HTML
- JavaScript

I've done a whole bunch of different modules, resulting in experience with many different projects, including...
- An augmented reality diagram explanation program in association with IBM
- Developing an AI search algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph
- Using OpenCV for "cleaning up" an image for detecting pneumonia in x-ray images of lungs
- Developing a machine learning algorithm to classify raisins

And here's what I'm currently working on...
- Final year project at uni; processing crowdsourced free-text data
- Interactive multimedia and games design
- Deep learning algorithms
- Music computing
