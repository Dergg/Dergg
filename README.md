Hi, I'm Derg. I'm a third year CompSci student at Durham University, always looking to expand my skillset and apply my knowledge to different things.
I've got experience in the following programming languages...
- C / C++ / C#
- Python
- Visual Basic
- HTML
- JavaScript

I've done a whole bunch of different modules, resulting in experience with many different projects, including...
- An augmented reality diagram explanation program in association with IBM
- Developing multiple AI search algorithms for finding shortest path, including PREACO and Simulated Annealing
- Using OpenCV for "cleaning up" an image for detecting pneumonia in x-ray images of lungs
- Developing a machine learning algorithm to classify raisins
- Deep learning algorithms to classify images (AddNIST) and generate images (CIFAR-100)
- Final year project at uni; processing crowdsourced free-text data
- Virtual reality in Python using PyGame
- Music computing algorithm to visualise music, "Simulated Synaesthesia"
- TD3 reinforcement learning algorithm for BipedalWalker

And here's what I'm currently working on...
- Data bootcamp with JustIT

I'm looking for work, as well!

Outside of computer science related activities, I'm actively looking at working on VRChat avatars and worlds, as well as hoping to start a project based on real life racing to work as a virtual transponder for simulator racing applications.
